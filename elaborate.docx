NIR Composition Analyzer
Machine Learning for Spectroscopy Data

1. Overview
Purpose: Predict material composition (protein, fat, carbs) from NIR spectra using AI.
Key Features:

Interactive GUI with 6 visualization types

Real-time predictions via ONNX model

Error analysis and sample comparison

2. How It Works
Step 1: Load Data
Input: CSV file with:

100 columns (NIR spectra: 800–2500 nm)

3 columns (true protein/fat/carbs %)

Click "Browse" to select file → "Load & Predict".

Step 2: Model Prediction
Pre-trained ONNX model processes spectra.

Output: Predicted compositions for all samples.

Step 3: Visualize Results
Six plots generated:

Plot	What It Shows	Why It Matters
1. NIR Spectrum	Absorbance vs. wavelength	Raw spectral features
2. True vs Predicted	Side-by-side bar chart	Model accuracy per component
3. Prediction Error	Difference (Prediction - Truth)	Over/under-prediction trends
4. Feature Importance	Spectral gradient as importance	Key wavelengths for predictions
5. All Samples Scatter	True vs. predicted for all data	Global model performance
6. Residuals	Errors vs. predicted values	Checks for systematic bias
3. Example Output
Sample 5 Results:

True: Protein=15.2%, Fat=10.1%, Carbs=60.3%

Predicted: Protein=14.9%, Fat=9.8%, Carbs=61.0%

Error: Protein=-0.3, Fat=-0.3, Carbs=+0.7

Insights:

Model slightly underestimates fat/protein.

Wavelengths near 1500 nm drive predictions.

4. Technical Details
Model: ONNX format (optimized for cross-platform use).

Libraries: onnxruntime, pandas, matplotlib, tkinter.

Data Requirements:

Spectra: 100 points (800–2500 nm range).

Compositions: Protein, fat, carbs as percentages.
